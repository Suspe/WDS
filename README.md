Sensor Data Visualization 
Communcation with the microcontroller board and visualising sensor data information in form of swank graphical hourglass mimicing the board motion. 
STM32F4E11 and it's embedded accelerometer have been used to deduct lean position of the board.
Refactoring remains to be done.
